# Chapter 34 — Interview with Alvaro Hernandez Tortosa

> [🧑‍🏫 Interactive lesson](lessons/0033-interview-with-alvaro-hernandez-tortosa.html)

> [!info] Source and scope
> Individual learning reference for *The Art of PostgreSQL*, following the publisher's 2026 chapter numbering. The local vault contains no copy of the book text; this note teaches the chapter's listed subject using the public contents and general PostgreSQL knowledge.

**Book part:** Part VI — Data Modeling  
**Official contents:** [The Art of PostgreSQL](https://theartofpostgresql.com/book/contents/)

## 📖 Chapter Summary

The interview compares relational and document models and discusses PostgreSQL as a NoSQL target through ToroDB. Use it to examine when one model fits the application's access patterns and where the models can coexist.

## 🧭 Key Ideas

- **Problem:** Identify the application or data-management need before choosing a SQL construct or PostgreSQL feature.
- **Mechanics:** Follow how inputs become rows, how PostgreSQL applies operators/constraints, and what result or state change the database guarantees.
- **Trade-off:** Consider correctness, query shape, write cost, operational burden, and the server version together.

## 🌐 Practical Application

When applying this chapter, write down one real query or invariant from your application. State the expected rows or state transition, include boundary cases, and check the result against representative data. For performance-related behavior, inspect the plan and measure; for integrity behavior, try invalid and concurrent writes.

## 🧪 Check Your Understanding

**Q1:** What practical problem does this chapter help solve?

**Q2:** What assumption would make an example from this chapter incorrect or unsafe in production?

**Q3:** What evidence would you collect to decide whether this technique is working?

> [!answer]- 📋 Answers
> **A1:** The interview compares relational and document models and discusses PostgreSQL as a NoSQL target through ToroDB. Use it to examine when one model fits the application's access patterns and where the models can coexist.
>
> **A2:** The answer depends on the data shape, workload, transaction boundaries, PostgreSQL version, and invariants. Make the assumption explicit and test the edge case that could violate it.
>
> **A3:** Check correctness with representative and boundary-case data. For performance, inspect `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` and workload measurements; for integrity, verify PostgreSQL accepts valid cases and rejects invalid ones.

## 🔨 Hands-On Practice

**Goal:** Apply one idea from this chapter to a small, disposable schema or the book's companion dataset.

**Steps:**

1. State the expected result or invariant before writing SQL.
2. Implement the simplest query or schema rule that expresses it.
3. Try normal, boundary, and invalid inputs.
4. Record what PostgreSQL guarantees and what the application must still handle.

**Done when:** You can explain the result and its limitations without relying on an unexplained ORM behavior or a single happy-path example.

## 🧠 Things to Remember

- Start with the requirement and expected result, then choose the SQL feature.
- Make ordering, null behavior, cardinality, and transaction assumptions explicit where relevant.
- Validate the behavior with realistic data and your deployed PostgreSQL version.
