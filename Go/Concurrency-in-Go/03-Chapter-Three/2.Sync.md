# 🧵 sync Package: `sync.Once` and `sync.Pool` in Go

---

## 🔂 sync.Once – Run Only Once

### ❓ What does this print?

```go
var count int
increment := func() {
    count++
}

var once sync.Once
var increments sync.WaitGroup
increments.Add(100)

for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
    go func() {
        defer increments.Done()
        once.Do(increment)
    }()
}

increments.Wait()
fmt.Printf("Count is %d\n", count)
````

### ✅ Output:

```
Count is 1
```

> Even though `Do()` is called in 100 goroutines, `sync.Once` ensures `increment` is run **only once**.

---

### 🧠 Key Concept: `sync.Once.Do()`

- Ensures the **function passed** is executed **only once**, regardless of how many times or from how many goroutines it's called.
    
- Useful for **safe one-time initialization**.
    

---

## 🧪 Second Example

```go
var count int
increment := func() { count++ }
decrement := func() { count-- }

var once sync.Once
once.Do(increment)
once.Do(decrement)

fmt.Printf("Count: %d\n", count)
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Count: 1
```

> Only the **first call to `Do()`** executes its function. The second call is ignored — regardless of being a different function.

---

## ⚠️ Deadlock Example: Mutual Dependence

```go
var onceA, onceB sync.Once
var initB func()

initA := func() { onceB.Do(initB) }
initB = func() { onceA.Do(initA) }

onceA.Do(initA)
```

- This will **deadlock** because:
    
    - `onceA` → waits for `initA`
        
    - `initA` → waits for `onceB.Do(initB)`
        
    - `initB` → waits for `onceA.Do(initA)` again
        

🛑 **Circular dependency** in `sync.Once` leads to deadlock.

---

## 💡 Best Practice for `sync.Once`

- Wrap `sync.Once` usage in a small, **tight scope** (function or type)
    
- Avoid interdependent `Once.Do()` calls
    
- Ensure initialization code is **non-blocking**

## 💧 sync.Pool – Object Pooling

### 🧠 What is `sync.Pool`?

- A **concurrent-safe object pool**
    
- Holds pre-allocated objects for reuse (e.g. database connections, buffers)
    
- Efficient for managing:
    
    - Memory usage
        
    - Expensive-to-create objects
        

---

### 🔧 Pool Structure

```go
myPool := &sync.Pool{
    New: func() interface{} {
        fmt.Println("Creating new instance.")
        return struct{}{}
    },
}
```

```go
myPool.Get()          // Creates a new instance (calls New)
instance := myPool.Get()
myPool.Put(instance)  // Adds back to pool
myPool.Get()          // Reuses instance
```

---

### 🧪 Memory Efficiency Example

```go
var numCalcsCreated int
calcPool := &sync.Pool{
    New: func() interface{} {
        numCalcsCreated += 1
        mem := make([]byte, 1024)  // 1KB slice
        return &mem
    },
}

// Seed 4KB (4 instances)
for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
    calcPool.Put(calcPool.New())
}

const numWorkers = 1024 * 1024
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Add(numWorkers)

for i := 0; i < numWorkers; i++ {
    go func() {
        defer wg.Done()
        mem := calcPool.Get().(*[]byte)
        defer calcPool.Put(mem)
        // Simulated quick usage
    }()
}

wg.Wait()
fmt.Printf("%d calculators were created.\n", numCalcsCreated)
```

### ✅ Output:

```
8 calculators were created.
```

> 🔥 Without a pool, this could have required **1GB+ of memory**. With `sync.Pool`, only a small number of instances were reused efficiently.

---

## ⚡ Pool for Performance-Critical Code

### Simulated Expensive Connection

```go
func connectToService() interface{} {
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    return struct{}{}
}
```

### ❌ Without Pool

Each incoming request creates a new service connection, causing:

- High latency
    
- Slower throughput
    

```go
conn, _ := net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:8080")
```

### ✅ With Pool

```go
func warmServiceConnCache() *sync.Pool {
    p := &sync.Pool{New: connectToService}
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        p.Put(p.New())
    }
    return p
}
```

Performance boost:

|Without Pool|With Pool|
|---|---|
|1e9 ns/op|🚀 2.9e6 ns/op|

> ⚡ **~1000x faster** when using pre-warmed connection objects!

---

## ✅ Best Practices for `sync.Pool`

- Always provide a **thread-safe `New` function**
    
- Never assume the state of a pooled object
    
- Always call `Put()` when done (ideally with `defer`)
    
- Use when:
    
    - Objects are **homogeneous** (same type/size)
        
    - Expensive to allocate or reuse is frequent
        

---

## 🚫 When NOT to Use Pool

- If objects vary **greatly in shape/size**
    
- If you're doing **a lot of re-initializing**
    
- If instantiating a new one is **cheaper** than sanitizing a reused one

## 📌 Summary

|Feature|`sync.Once`|`sync.Pool`|
|---|---|---|
|Purpose|Run function exactly once|Reuse expensive objects|
|Thread-Safe|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|
|Pitfalls|Deadlock from circular `Do()` calls|Improper reuse or unreturned objects|
|Typical Use|One-time initialization|Object caching / memory pooling|

✨ With these patterns, you can write safe, efficient, and highly concurrent Go code.
