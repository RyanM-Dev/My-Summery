# 🧳 Confinement in Go: Safer Concurrency Without Synchronization

In concurrent programming with Go, **confinement** offers a **powerful, low-risk** alternative to synchronization. It ensures safe access to shared data by limiting who can see or mutate it—**not by coordinating access, but by preventing it altogether**.

---

## 🧠 Four Models for Safe Concurrency in Go

Go provides multiple strategies to make concurrent code safe:

### 🔐 1. Synchronization Primitives

Use `sync.Mutex`, `sync.WaitGroup`, etc., to control access.

### 🔄 2. Communication Over Sharing

Use **channels** to synchronize by design—no shared memory.

### 🧊 3. Immutable Data

Immutable values are **inherently safe**: no one can change them.  
📝 In Go, this means **passing copies** of values—not pointers.

### 🚧 4. Confinement (Focus of This Section)

Ensure that **only one goroutine can access mutable data**.  
No need for locks—just **limit scope** and design.

---

## 🚪 What Is Confinement?

Confinement is about **exclusive access**:

- A goroutine owns the data
    
- Others can't reach it
    
- **No synchronization is needed**
    

### 📦 Two Types of Confinement

#### 🧭 Ad Hoc Confinement

- Done by **convention**, not enforced by the compiler
    
- Prone to **human error**, especially in large teams
    

##### 🧪 Example:

```go
data := make([]int, 4)
loopData := func(handleData chan<- int) {
    defer close(handleData)
    for i := range data {
        handleData <- data[i]
    }
}
handleData := make(chan int)
go loopData(handleData)
for num := range handleData {
    fmt.Println(num)
}
```

➡️ `data` is shared across goroutines, **but not protected**.  
Mistakes can easily introduce race conditions here.  
⚠️ Static analysis tools **might** catch violations, but aren’t guaranteed.

---

#### 📚 Lexical Confinement

- Uses **scope** to enforce confinement
    
- The compiler **prevents** misuse
    

##### ✅ Example:

```go
chanOwner := func() <-chan int {
    results := make(chan int, 5)
    go func() {
        defer close(results)
        for i := 0; i <= 5; i++ {
            results <- i
        }
    }()
    return results
}

consumer := func(results <-chan int) {
    for result := range results {
        fmt.Printf("Received: %d\n", result)
    }
    fmt.Println("Done receiving!")
}

results := chanOwner()
consumer(results)
```

🎯 `results` is **write-confined** to `chanOwner`, and **read-confined** to `consumer`.  
→ Misuse is **impossible** due to Go's type system (`<-chan int`).

---

### 🔐 Confinement With Non-Concurrent-Safe Structures

Consider `bytes.Buffer`, which is **not safe** for concurrent use:

```go
printData := func(wg *sync.WaitGroup, data []byte) {
    defer wg.Done()
    var buff bytes.Buffer
    for _, b := range data {
        fmt.Fprintf(&buff, "%c", b)
    }
    fmt.Println(buff.String())
}

var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Add(2)

data := []byte("golang")
go printData(&wg, data[:3])
go printData(&wg, data[3:])
wg.Wait()
```

✅ Each goroutine works on a **non-overlapping slice**, so:

- No race condition
    
- No need for synchronization
    
- Data is lexically confined

## 🎯 Why Use Confinement?

|Benefit|Explanation|
|---|---|
|🧠 Simpler Code|No need to think about locking|
|🚀 Better Performance|Avoids critical sections|
|✅ Safer Defaults|Impossible to misuse with lexical scope|
|👀 Easier to Read|Code is locally scoped and synchronous-like|

> 🔑 **Use confinement to make correct code the only code possible.**  
> 🛡️ When scope does the job, locks are unnecessary.
