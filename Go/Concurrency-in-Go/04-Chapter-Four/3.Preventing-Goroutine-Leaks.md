# 🛡️ Preventing Goroutine Leaks in Go

Goroutines in Go are **cheap** and **easy to spawn**, but they’re **not garbage collected** — meaning they can accumulate silently and cause memory leaks if not managed correctly 🚨.

This guide outlines common goroutine leak patterns and how to **prevent** them using idiomatic **cancellation patterns** such as the `done` channel and the **or-channel pattern**.

---

## 💡 Why Do Goroutines Leak?

Goroutines terminate when:

1. ✅ They complete their work.
    
2. ❌ They encounter an unrecoverable error.
    
3. ⚠️ They're **told to stop** (cancellation).
    

Only the **third case** requires our intervention — and it’s the most important due to goroutine **interdependence**. One goroutine may rely on others (like a graph 🌐). The **parent goroutine**, which holds context, should be able to **cancel** its children.

---

## 🔥 Example: Goroutine Leak

```go
doWork := func(strings <-chan string) <-chan interface{} {
    completed := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer fmt.Println("doWork exited.")
        defer close(completed)
        for s := range strings {
            fmt.Println(s)
        }
    }()
    return completed
}

doWork(nil)
fmt.Println("Done.")
```

### ⚠️ What’s the Problem?

- We passed a **nil** channel.
    
- The goroutine blocks **forever** on `range strings`.
    
- In real apps, this leads to memory leaks over time.
    

---

## ✅ Solution: Use a `done` Channel

Use a **cancellation signal** from the parent goroutine:

```go
doWork := func(done <-chan interface{}, strings <-chan string) <-chan interface{} {
    terminated := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer fmt.Println("doWork exited.")
        defer close(terminated)
        for {
            select {
            case s := <-strings:
                fmt.Println(s)
            case <-done:
                return
            }
        }
    }()
    return terminated
}

done := make(chan interface{})
terminated := doWork(done, nil)

go func() {
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Canceling doWork goroutine...")
    close(done)
}()

<-terminated
fmt.Println("Done.")
```

🧠 **Pattern**: Place `done` as the **first parameter**, use `for-select`, and watch for cancellation signals.

## 🔄 Writing to a Channel (Blocked Writer Problem)

```go
newRandStream := func() <-chan int {
    randStream := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        defer fmt.Println("newRandStream closure exited.")
        defer close(randStream)
        for {
            randStream <- rand.Int()
        }
    }()
    return randStream
}
```

### ❌ Problem:

- Once the consumer stops reading after 3 values, the goroutine blocks **forever** on `randStream <-`.
    

---

## ✅ Fix With `done` Channel

```go
newRandStream := func(done <-chan interface{}) <-chan int {
    randStream := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        defer fmt.Println("newRandStream closure exited.")
        defer close(randStream)
        for {
            select {
            case randStream <- rand.Int():
            case <-done:
                return
            }
        }
    }()
    return randStream
}

done := make(chan interface{})
randStream := newRandStream(done)

fmt.Println("3 random ints:")
for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%d: %d\n", i, <-randStream)
}
close(done)
time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
```

🧠 **Takeaway**: Always give writers a way to stop via `done`.

---

## ✅ Convention Summary

> 🧾 **If a goroutine spawns another goroutine, it's responsible for ensuring it can cancel it.**

This ensures scalability and composability in large systems.

---

## 🔀 The or-Channel Pattern

Sometimes, you want a **composite `done` channel** that listens to multiple cancellation signals.

### ✅ Example: Recursive `or` Channel

```go
var or func(channels ...<-chan interface{}) <-chan interface{}
or = func(channels ...<-chan interface{}) <-chan interface{} {
    switch len(channels) {
    case 0:
        return nil
    case 1:
        return channels[0]
    }

    orDone := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer close(orDone)
        switch len(channels) {
        case 2:
            select {
            case <-channels[0]:
            case <-channels[1]:
            }
        default:
            select {
            case <-channels[0]:
            case <-channels[1]:
            case <-channels[2]:
            case <-or(append(channels[3:], orDone)...):
            }
        }
    }()
    return orDone
}
```

### 🧠 Key Concepts:

- Recursive: builds a tree of `select`s.
    
- If **any** channel closes, the result channel (`orDone`) closes.
    
- Prevents goroutines from being orphaned when listening to **multiple cancellation signals**.
    

---

## ✅ Best Practices

✔ Always pass `done` channels into goroutines.  
✔ Use `select` inside `for` loops to monitor `done`.  
✔ Use `defer` to clean up (`close` channels, log exit, etc.).  
✔ Use the **or-channel** pattern to combine cancellation signals dynamically.  
✔ Remember: **goroutines are not garbage collected** — they must be explicitly managed!

---

🧪 **Hint**: For testability and observability, always log when goroutines exit.

🧩 **Pro Tip**: Use `context.Context` in production — it builds on these concepts with deadlines, timeouts, and cascading cancellation.

# 🔄 Error Handling in Concurrent Go Programs

In concurrent programs, error handling can be tricky. Go’s choice to forgo exceptions emphasizes giving error paths the **same attention** as core algorithms. When working with multiple goroutines, consider **who** is responsible for handling errors and **how** they coordinate.

---

## ❓ Fundamental Question

> **Who should handle the error?**  
> At some point, errors must bubble up and be acted upon. In a concurrent setting, independent goroutines lack full context to decide how to react.

---

## 🚧 Problematic Example

```go
checkStatus := func(
    done <-chan interface{},
    urls ...string,
) <-chan *http.Response {
    responses := make(chan *http.Response)
    go func() {
        defer close(responses)
        for _, url := range urls {
            resp, err := http.Get(url)
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Println(err)    // ❌ Goroutine prints and “hopes” someone notices
                continue
            }
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case responses <- resp:
            }
        }
    }()
    return responses
}

done := make(chan interface{})
defer close(done)
urls := []string{"https://www.google.com", "https://badhost"}
for response := range checkStatus(done, urls...) {
    fmt.Printf("Response: %v\n", response.Status)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Response: 200 OK  
Get https://badhost: dial tcp: lookup badhost on 127.0.1.1:53: no such host
```

- The goroutine has **no choice** but to print errors to `stdout`.
    
- It can’t pass errors back through the channel of `*http.Response`.
    

---

## ✅ Improved Solution: Coupling Result & Error

Define a `Result` type to return **both** response and error:

```go
type Result struct {
    Response *http.Response
    Error    error
}

checkStatus := func(done <-chan interface{}, urls ...string) <-chan Result {
    results := make(chan Result)
    go func() {
        defer close(results)
        for _, url := range urls {
            resp, err := http.Get(url)
            // 📝 Create Result with both fields
            results <- Result{Response: resp, Error: err}
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            default:
            }
        }
    }()
    return results
}

done := make(chan interface{})
defer close(done)
urls := []string{"https://www.google.com", "https://badhost"}
for result := range checkStatus(done, urls...) {
    if result.Error != nil {
        fmt.Printf("error: %v\n", result.Error)
        continue
    }
    fmt.Printf("Response: %v\n", result.Response.Status)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Response: 200 OK  
error: Get https://badhost: dial tcp: lookup badhost on 127.0.1.1:53: no such host
```

> **Tip:** Treat errors as “first-class citizens” in your channel payloads, just like in synchronous Go functions.

---

## ✋ Advanced: Stop After N Errors

You can use the same pattern to implement more complex logic—e.g., aborting after three errors:

```go
done := make(chan interface{})
defer close(done)

errCount := 0
urls := []string{"a", "https://www.google.com", "b", "c", "d"}

for result := range checkStatus(done, urls...) {
    if result.Error != nil {
        fmt.Printf("error: %v\n", result.Error)
        errCount++
        if errCount >= 3 {
            fmt.Println("Too many errors, breaking!")
            break
        }
        continue
    }
    fmt.Printf("Response: %v\n", result.Response.Status)
}
```

**Output:**

```
error: Get a: unsupported protocol scheme ""
Response: 200 OK  
error: Get b: unsupported protocol scheme ""
error: Get c: unsupported protocol scheme ""
Too many errors, breaking!
```

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **Separate concerns**: Producer goroutines should only produce `Result` values, not decide on program-wide error policies.
    
- **Centralize error handling**: The main (or coordinating) goroutine, which has full context, should decide whether to retry, abort, or log.
    
- **Use typed results**: Pair your payload with an `error` in a struct to handle outcomes **consistently**.
    

---

**Hints & Best Practices**

- Define clear result types early when designing concurrent pipelines.
    
- Use a `done` channel (or `context.Context`) to signal cancellation.
    
- Avoid printing from library code; return errors instead.
    
- Consider more advanced patterns (fan-in/fan-out, error aggregates) for large-scale pipelines.
