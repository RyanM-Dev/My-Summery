# 🚀 Go Testing with Environment Variables & Public API

Here's a clear, detailed markdown for your Obsidian note, covering testing in Go, including environment variables, storing test data, caching, and testing public APIs:

---

## 🌳 Testing with Environment Variables

### 🔧 Overview

Using **environment variables** to configure your application is a popular and effective practice. Go provides built-in support to simplify environment variable testing with the `t.Setenv()` method provided by the `*testing.T` type.

### 🛠️ How to use `t.Setenv()`

```go
// Assume ProcessEnvVars is a function that processes environment variables
// and returns a struct with an OutputFormat field.
func TestEnvVarProcess(t *testing.T) {
    // Set environment variable specifically for this test.
    t.Setenv("OUTPUT_FORMAT", "JSON")

    cfg := ProcessEnvVars()

    if cfg.OutputFormat != "JSON" {
        t.Error("OutputFormat not set correctly")
    }
    // OUTPUT_FORMAT automatically resets after test completes.
}
```

**💡 Behind the scenes:**

- `t.Setenv()` registers an environment variable and automatically restores its previous state after the test using a `Cleanup` function.

### 📌 Good Practice: Abstract Environment Variables

While environment variables are great, your core application logic shouldn't directly depend on them:

- ✅ **Best practice:** Copy environment variables into configuration structs at the very beginning of your program (e.g., in `main()`).
    
- ✅ **Advantage:** Makes your code easier to test, reuse, and maintain.
    

**👍 Recommended Libraries:**

- **Viper**
    
- **envconfig**
    
- **GoDotEnv** (great for `.env` files used in development or CI environments)
    

Example using **GoDotEnv**:

```go
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/joho/godotenv"
)

func init() {
    // Loads environment variables from `.env` file.
    if err := godotenv.Load(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Error loading .env file")
    }
}
```

## 📂 Storing Sample Test Data (`testdata` Directory)

When writing tests that use external data files, Go has a **convention** for storing test files:

- Create a subdirectory named `testdata` within your package.
    
- Go automatically recognizes this directory for test resources.
    

```plaintext
your_package/
├── main.go
├── main_test.go
└── testdata/
    ├── sample.json
    └── test_input.txt
```

- Access your test data using relative paths (e.g., `testdata/sample.json`).
    

📍 **Example Access**:

```go
import (
    "os"
    "testing"
)

func TestLoadSampleData(t *testing.T) {
    data, err := os.ReadFile("testdata/sample.json")
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal("failed to load testdata:", err)
    }
    // Use data in your tests...
}
```

---

## 📦 Caching Test Results

Just as Go caches compiled packages (as discussed in earlier chapters), it also caches test results:

- ✅ Tests are cached and won't run again if code or testdata hasn't changed.
    
- ✅ To force tests to always run, use:
    

```bash
go test -count=1
```

---

## 📌 Testing Your Public API (Black-Box Testing)

Go allows you to test just the public API of a package:

- Convention: Name test package as `<packagename>_test`.
    
- Must import your production package explicitly.
    

### 📖 Example Public API Test

Suppose you have this exported function in `pubadder` package (`pubadder.go`):

```go
package pubadder

// AddNumbers adds two integers.
func AddNumbers(x, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

To test this as public API, create `adder_public_test.go` with package named `pubadder_test`:

```go
package pubadder_test

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/learning-go-book-2e/ch15/sample_code/pubadder"
)

func TestAddNumbers(t *testing.T) {
    result := pubadder.AddNumbers(2, 3)

    if result != 5 {
        t.Error("incorrect result: expected 5, got", result)
    }
}
```

🔑 **Key Points:**

- Test package is named `pubadder_test` (not just `pubadder`).
    
- The tested package must be imported explicitly, even if it's in the same directory.
    
- This enforces black-box testing, restricting your tests to public API methods, constants, types, and variables.
    

**💡 When is this useful?**

- Testing your package from the perspective of an external consumer.
    
- Ensuring your public API behaves correctly and is user-friendly.

## 📋 Module Declaration

If you're creating these examples manually, ensure your `go.mod` file is structured correctly:

```plaintext
module github.com/learning-go-book-2e/ch15
```

And your folder structure:

```plaintext
ch15/
└── sample_code/
    └── pubadder/
        ├── pubadder.go
        ├── adder_public_test.go
        └── go.mod
```

## 🌟 Quick Summary Table

|Topic|Key Points|Example Command|
|---|---|---|
|Environment Variable Testing|`t.Setenv()`, abstract into structs, libraries like Viper, envconfig, GoDotEnv|`t.Setenv("KEY", "value")`|
|Test Data Storage|Use `testdata` directory, relative paths|`os.ReadFile("testdata/sample.json")`|
|Test Caching|Automatically cached, force run with `-count=1`|`go test -count=1`|
|Public API (Black-Box) Testing|`<packagename>_test`, import explicitly|`package pubadder_test`|

---

📌 **Hints & Tips:**

- **Keep tests independent:** Don't rely on external states.
    
- **Be explicit:** Clearly define what's being tested.
    
- **Use descriptive test names:** Helps readability and maintainability.
    
- **Leverage third-party libraries:** Simplify and standardize configurations.
    

This structure ensures clear testing, easy maintainability, and robust, reusable Go code! 🎯
