### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Display OS Info (`uname`)**

```bash
$ uname
```

- **Output:**
    

```
Linux
```

- Shows the **name** of the operating system (in this case, Linux).
    

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Display Full OS Info (`uname -a`)**

```bash
$ uname -a
```

- **Output:**
    

```

---

## üó£Ô∏è Echo Command with Variables

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Interpret Variable Inside Echo (`"something $SHELL"`)**

```bash
$ echo "Your shell is: $SHELL"
```

- **Output:**
    

```
Your shell is: /bin/bash
```

- **Explanation:** The **`$SHELL`** variable is interpreted inside the double quotes and shows the current shell being used (e.g., `/bin/bash`).
    

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Print Variable Literally (`'something $SHELL'`)**

```bash
$ echo 'Your shell is: $SHELL'
```

- **Output:**
    

```
Your shell is: $SHELL
```

- **Explanation:** The **`$SHELL`** variable is **not interpreted** inside the single quotes, so it prints the literal text `$SHELL`.
    

---

## üß© Escaping Characters

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Escape Special Characters (`\`)**

```bash
$ echo "The cost is \$5"

# üêß Linux Commands: Directory Navigation, Command Types, and Enabling/Disabling Commands

Here‚Äôs your **organized guide** with **commands, explanations, and expected outputs**:

---

## üè† Directory Navigation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Go Back to Previous Directory (`cd -`)**

```bash
$ cd -
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **Works like the back button** in Windows: takes you to the **previous directory** you were in.
        
    - It's a **quick way to toggle** between two directories.
        
- **Example:**
    

```bash
$ cd /home/user/Documents
$ cd /var/log
$ cd -   # ‚¨Ö Back to /home/user/Documents
```

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Absolute vs Relative Paths

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Absolute Path**

- **Starts from the root** directory (`/`).
    
- Always **starts from `/`** and gives the **full path**.
    
- Example:
    

```bash
$ cd /home/user/Documents
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Relative Path**

- **Relative to the current directory**.
    
- Doesn‚Äôt start from the root `/`, but from wherever you are currently.
    
- Example:
    

```bash
$ cd Documents  # If you're already in /home/user/
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Type

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Check If Command Is Built-In or Installed (`type`)**

```bash
$ type cd
```

- **Output:**
    

```
cd is a shell builtin
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **`cd`** is a **builtin command** in the shell, meaning it‚Äôs a **shell function** and doesn't exist as an external program.
        
- **Example:**
    

```bash
$ type ls
```

- **Output:**
    

```
ls is /bin/ls
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **`ls`** is an **external command** installed in the `/bin` directory.
        

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Show All Built-In Commands (`compgen -b`)**

```bash
$ compgen -b
```

- **Output:**
    

```
alias
bg
bind
break
cd
...
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **Lists all built-in commands** available in the shell.
        

---

## üîß Enabling & Disabling Commands

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Disable a Command (`enable -n "command"`)**

```bash
$ enable -n cd
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **Disables the `cd` command**.
        
    - You won't be able to use `cd` until it's re-enabled.
        

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Enable a Command (`enable "command"`)**

```bash
$ enable cd
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **Re-enables the `cd` command**, allowing it to be used again.
        
# üêß Understanding Linux Environment Variables and Command-Line Basics

Here's a detailed **overview of environment variables** and how they work, along with **examples and outputs** for each step:

---

## üåç Common Environment Variables

### **Some commonly used environment variables**:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`BASH_VERSION`|Current Bash shell instance‚Äôs version number|
|`EDITOR`|Default editor used by shell commands|
|`GROUPS`|User account‚Äôs group memberships|
|`HISTFILE`|Name of the user‚Äôs shell command history file|
|`HISTSIZE`|Maximum number of commands stored in history|
|`HOME`|Current user‚Äôs home directory name|
|`HOSTNAME`|Current system‚Äôs host name|
|`LANG`|Locale category for the shell|
|`LC_*`|Various locale settings that override `LANG`|
|`LC_ALL`|Locale category for the shell that overrides `LANG`|
|`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`|Colon-separated list of library directories to search for libraries|
|`PATH`|Colon-separated list of directories to search for commands|
|`PS1`|Primary shell command-line interface prompt string|
|`PS2`|Secondary shell command-line interface prompt string|
|`PWD`|User account‚Äôs current working directory|
|`SHLVL`|Current shell level (indicates if you‚Äôre in a subshell)|
|`TZ`|User‚Äôs time zone, if different from system‚Äôs time zone|
|`UID`|User account‚Äôs user identification number|
|`VISUAL`|Default screen-based editor used by some shell commands|

---

## üîç Viewing Active Environment Variables

### **Using the `set` command**:

```bash
$ set
```

- **Output (snipped)**:
    

```
BASH=/bin/bash
HISTFILE=/home/Christine/.bash_history
HISTSIZE=1000
HOME=/home/Christine
HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
PS1='$ '
PS2='> '
SHELL=/bin/bash
```

- **Explanation:** Displays all active environment variables and their values.
    

### **Using the `env` and `printenv` commands**:

```bash
$ env
$ printenv
```

- These commands show environment variables as well, and are useful when you have locally defined variables, such as those in a shell script.
    

---

## üõ†Ô∏è PATH and Command Execution

### **Viewing the PATH variable**:

```bash
$ echo $PATH
```

- **Output**:
    

```
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/Christine/.local/bin:/home/Christine/bin
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - The **PATH** variable holds a colon-separated list of directories that the shell uses to search for executable programs.
        

### **Running a program outside the PATH**:

```bash
$ ls /home/Christine/Hello.sh
/home/Christine/Hello.sh
$ Hello.sh
bash: Hello.sh: command not found‚Ä¶
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **Hello.sh** is in a directory **not in the PATH**, so the shell cannot find it by simply entering its name.
        

### **Running a program with its absolute path**:

```bash
$ /home/Christine/Hello.sh
Hello World
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - Running the program **using its absolute path** executes it without any issues, even though it‚Äôs outside the PATH directories.
        

### **Using the `which` command** to find a program:

```bash
$ which Hello.sh
/usr/bin/which: no Hello.sh in (/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/Christine/.local/bin:/home/Christine/bin)
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - The **`which`** command searches through the directories listed in the **PATH** variable to locate a program. Here, it shows that **Hello.sh** is not in any of the directories.
        

### **Finding the location of an existing command**:

```bash
$ which echo
/usr/bin/echo
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **`echo`** is found in **`/usr/bin/echo`**, so you can run it directly or by specifying its path.
        

---

## üîÑ Modifying Environment Variables

### **Changing the `PS1` variable** (shell prompt):

```bash
$ PS1="My new prompt: "
My new prompt:
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **PS1** controls the primary shell prompt. Changing it will immediately reflect in your shell.
        

### **Effect of modifying `PS1` in a subshell**:

```bash
$ echo $PS1
$
$ bash
$ echo $PS1
My new prompt: 
$ exit
$
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **Subshells** created by running `bash` do not preserve changes to **PS1** unless **exported**. When you exit the subshell, the original prompt returns.
        

---

## üß≥ Making Changes Permanent with `export`

### **Using `export` to preserve environment variables**:

```bash
$ export PS1="KeepPrompt: "
KeepPrompt:
KeepPrompt: bash
KeepPrompt:
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - Using **`export`** ensures that the variable‚Äôs value **persists** across subshells.
        

---

## ‚ùå Unsetting Environment Variables

### **Using `unset` to remove a variable**:

```bash
$ echo $EDITOR
$ export EDITOR=nano
$ echo $EDITOR
nano
$ unset EDITOR
$ echo $EDITOR
```

- **Explanation:**
    
    - **`unset`** removes an environment variable, in this case, **EDITOR**.
        

---

### ‚ö† **Caution** with `unset`:

- Be careful when unsetting critical variables like **PS1** or **PATH**, as it can disrupt the shell‚Äôs functionality.
