## 📜 Philosophy of Meilisearch

Meilisearch’s core philosophy is to provide a **simple, intuitive experience** for both developers and end-users while delivering **ultra-relevant search results**. Here’s how it achieves this:

- **Ease of Use**: Designed to be developer-friendly from the start, with minimal setup and intuitive APIs.
- **Relevance**: Uses **default ranking rules** optimized for most use cases, with options to customize for specific needs.
- **Not a Database**: Meilisearch is a **search engine**, not a primary data store. Only include searchable data to optimize performance.
- **Prefix Search**: Powers a **search-as-you-type** experience with response times under **50 milliseconds**.

**Example** 🎯: Suppose you’re searching for "Star Wars" on a movie platform. Meilisearch’s prefix search returns results like "Star Wars: Episode IV" as you type "Sta", and its ranking rules prioritize recent or popular titles based on your settings.

**Warning** ⚠️: Avoid storing non-searchable data in Meilisearch to maintain fast response times. Use a separate database for non-search data.

## 🧪 Give It a Try: Search Preview

Meilisearch offers a **search preview** interface to test your search settings without writing front-end code. This is ideal for tweaking index settings and debugging relevance.

### 🎯 How to Access Search Preview
1. **Meilisearch Cloud**:
   - Log into your Meilisearch Cloud account.
   - Navigate to your project and select **Search Preview**.
   - Choose an index and perform keyword searches.
2. **Self-Hosted**:
   - Access `http://localhost:7700` in your browser.
   - Note: Local preview supports only plain searches with no customization.

**Example** 🎯: In the search preview, select a "movies" index, type "Kung Fu" in the search bar, and see results like "Kung Fu Panda" instantly. Enable **Ranking Score** to view how Meilisearch ranks each result.

**Tip** 💡: Use the **Export** option (cloud icon) to download your search query as JSON for testing in other environments.

## 📂 Documents in Meilisearch

Documents are the core building blocks of a Meilisearch database. Each document is an **object** containing one or more **fields**, which consist of an **attribute** (name) and a **value** (data).

### 🌟 Key Terms
- **Document**: An object containing data in the form of fields.
- **Field**: A pair of an attribute and its value.
- **Attribute**: A case-sensitive string naming the field (e.g., "title").
- **Value**: The data associated with an attribute, using any valid JSON type.
- **Primary Field**: A mandatory field containing the **primary key** (attribute) and **document ID** (value).

**Example** 🎯: A document in a movies index:

```json
{
  "id": 1564,
  "title": "Kung Fu Panda",
  "genres": "Children's Animation",
  "release-year": 2008,
  "cast": [
    { "Jack Black": "Po" },
    { "Jackie Chan": "Monkey" }
  ]
}
```


**How It Works**:
- **Attributes**: `id`, `title`, `genres`, `release-year`, `cast`.
- **Primary Field**: `id: 1564` (primary key is `id`, document ID is `1564`).
- **Values**: Can be strings (`"Kung Fu Panda"`), numbers (`2008`), or arrays/objects (`cast`).

**Tip** 💡: Ensure every document has a unique **document ID** to avoid overwriting existing documents.

### 📌 Fields in Depth
- **Attributes**: Case-sensitive strings (e.g., `Title` ≠ `title`).
- **Values**: Must be valid JSON types (string, number, boolean, array, object). Strings are limited to **65,535 positions**.
- **Flattening**: Nested objects are flattened during indexing (e.g., `cast.Jack Black` becomes a root-level key) but returned in their original structure.
- **Reserved Attributes**: Prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_geo` for geosearch).

**Example** 🎯: Flattening a nested object:
- Original: `{ "cast": { "Jack Black": "Po" } }`
- Indexed: `{ "cast.Jack Black": "Po" }`
- Returned: Original structure preserved.

**Warning** ⚠️: Strings exceeding 65,535 positions are ignored, so break long text into multiple fields if needed.

### 📌 Displayed and Searchable Fields
- **Default**: All fields are **searchable** (used to match queries) and **displayed** (included in results).
- **Customization**: Use the `update settings` endpoint to make fields:
  - Searchable but not displayed.
  - Displayed but not searchable.
  - Neither searchable nor displayed (stored but ignored during search).

**Example** 🎯: Make `id` non-searchable but displayed:
```bash
curl -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
  --data '{
    "searchableAttributes": ["title", "genres", "release-year"],
    "displayedAttributes": ["id", "title", "genres", "release-year"]
  }'
```

**Tip** 💡: Use non-searchable fields for metadata (e.g., internal IDs) to improve search performance.

### 📌 Primary Field
- **Requirement**: Every document must have a primary field with a unique **document ID**.
- **Primary Key**: The attribute name (e.g., `id`).
- **Document ID**: The unique value (e.g., `1564`). Must be an integer or a string with alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or underscores.
- **Error Handling**: Missing or invalid primary keys result in failed document uploads.

**Example** 🎯: Valid and invalid document IDs:

```json
{
  "valid_id": "_Aabc012_",
  "invalid_id": "@BI+* ^5h2%"
}
```


**Warning** ⚠️: If any document in a batch lacks the primary key, the entire batch fails.

## 📤 Uploading Documents

Meilisearch supports uploading documents in **JSON**, **NDJSON**, and **CSV** formats, with a default payload size limit of **100MB**. Adjust this limit using the `http-payload-size-limit` option.

### 🌟 Supported Formats

#### JSON
- **Format**: Key-value pairs in curly brackets.
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`.
- **Example**:
```html
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1564,
    "title": "Kung Fu Panda",
    "genres": "Children's Animation",
    "release-year": 2008
  }
]
```
```

#### NDJSON
- **Format**: Each line is a valid JSON object, separated by newlines.
- **Content-Type**: `application/x-ndjson`.
- **Advantages**: Faster writing, less CPU/memory-intensive, supports nested structures.
- **Example**:
```html
```x-ndjson
{ "id": 1564, "title": "Kung Fu Panda", "genres": "Children's Animation", "release-year": 2008 }
```
```

#### CSV
- **Format**: Values separated by a delimiter (default: `,`).
- **Content-Type**: `text/csv`.
- **Limitations**: No support for arrays or nested objects.
- **Example**:
```html
```csv
"id:number","title:string","genres:string","release-year:number"
"1564","Kung Fu Panda","Children's Animation","2008"
```
```

**Tip** 💡: Use NDJSON for large datasets with nested structures to balance performance and flexibility.

### 📌 Upload Considerations
- **Payload Format**: Ensure correct formatting (no extra commas, mismatched brackets, etc.).
- **Array Requirement**: Documents must be sent in an array, even for a single document.
- **RAM Usage**: Indexing consumes significant RAM. Monitor your system to avoid crashes when increasing batch sizes.

**Warning** ⚠️: Incorrect payload formatting will cause the entire upload to fail.

## 🗂️ Indexes in Meilisearch

An **index** is a collection of documents with associated settings, similar to a table in SQL or a collection in MongoDB. Each index has:
- A **unique identifier (UID)**.
- A **primary key**.
- Customizable **settings**.
- An arbitrary number of **documents**.

### 🌟 Index Creation
- **Implicit**: Adding documents/settings to a non-existent index creates it automatically.
- **Explicit**: Use the `create index` endpoint for safer production workflows.

**Example** 🎯: Create an index explicitly:
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes' \
  --data '{
    "uid": "movies",
    "primaryKey": "id"
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "taskUid": 1,
  "indexUid": "movies",
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "indexCreation",
  "enqueuedAt": "2025-07-20T06:51:00.123456Z"
}
```

**Tip** 💡: Explicit creation is safer for production as it avoids bundling multiple actions, making errors easier to diagnose.

### 📌 Index UID
- **Format**: Integer or string with alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or underscores.
- **Immutability**: Cannot be changed once set.

**Example** 🎯:
```json
{
  "uid": "movies",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-20T06:51:00.123456Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-20T06:51:00.123456Z"
}
```

### 📌 Primary Key
- **Requirement**: Every document in an index must have a unique value for the primary key.
- **Setting Options**:
  - Explicitly set during index creation or document addition.
  - Inferred by Meilisearch (looks for attributes ending in `id`, case-insensitive).
- **Errors**:
  - **Multiple Candidates**: Multiple `id`-like attributes cause an error.
  - **No Candidate**: No `id`-like attribute causes an error.
  - **Invalid ID**: Non-alphanumeric IDs (except hyphens/underscores) cause errors.
  - **Missing ID**: Missing primary key in any document fails the batch.

**Example** 🎯: Setting primary key on document addition:
```go
client.Index("books").AddDocuments([]map[string]interface{}{
  {
    "reference_number": 287947,
    "title": "Diary of a Wimpy Kid",
    "author": "Jeff Kinney"
  }
}, "reference_number")
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "taskUid": 1,
  "indexUid": "books",
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "documentAdditionOrUpdate",
  "enqueuedAt": "2025-07-20T06:51:00.123456Z"
}
```

**Warning** ⚠️: To change a primary key, delete all documents, update the key, then re-add documents.

### 📌 Index Settings
Customize search behavior with settings like:
- **Displayed/Searchable Attributes**: Control which fields are searched or returned.
- **Distinct Attribute**: Limits results to one per unique value (e.g., one "black jacket" per `costume_name`).
- **Faceting/Filtering**: Refine searches by categories (e.g., genre, rating).
- **Pagination**: Limits results to 1000 by default, adjustable.
- **Ranking Rules**: Sort results by relevance or custom rules.
- **Sortable Attributes**: Sort results by specific fields.
- **Stop Words**: Ignore common words for better performance.
- **Synonyms**: Treat similar words as equivalent.
- **Typo Tolerance**: Configure tolerance for misspellings.

**Example** 🎯: Update ranking rules:
```bash
curl -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings/ranking-rules' \
  --data '[
    "words",
    "typo",
    "proximity",
    "attribute",
    "sort:release-year:desc"
  ]'
```

**Tip** 💡: Prioritize recent movies by adding `sort:release-year:desc` to ranking rules.

## 🔄 Auto-Batching

Meilisearch’s **auto-batching** combines consecutive operations (e.g., document additions) targeting the same index into a single batch for faster processing.

- **Conditions**: Operations must target the same index and be consecutive.
- **Behavior**: Tasks in a batch share `startedAt`, `finishedAt`, and `duration`.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid documents are removed from the batch; internal errors fail the entire batch.
- **Cancellation**: Canceling a task discards the batch, and a new batch is created without the canceled task.

**Example** 🎯: Adding multiple documents:
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/documents' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
    { "id": 1564, "title": "Kung Fu Panda" },
    { "id": 1565, "title": "The Matrix" }
  ]'
```

**Tip** 💡: Use auto-batching for large datasets to improve indexing speed.

## 🖼️ Configuring Search Preview

The search preview interface in Meilisearch Cloud allows you to:
- Select an index and perform keyword searches.
- Enable **Ranking Score** to analyze result relevance.
- Configure **sorting**, **filtering**, and **faceting** (requires pre-configured attributes).
- Use **AI-powered search** if enabled.
- Access **Advanced Parameters** for field selection and language settings.
- **Export** queries as JSON for external testing.

**Example** 🎯: Filter by genre in the search preview:
1. Set `genres` as a filterable attribute:
```bash
curl -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings/filterable-attributes' \
  --data '["genres"]'
```
2. In the search preview, add a filter: `genres = "Children's Animation"`.

**Tip** 💡: Use faceting for interactive category-based searches (e.g., filter by "Action" or Ascending
or Descending).
