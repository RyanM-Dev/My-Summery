# üö¶ Performing Complex Joins with Multiple Tables in SQL

## Key Points
- Research suggests that complex joins with multiple tables in SQL are essential for combining data from various sources, enhancing data analysis capabilities.
- It seems likely that using different join types, like inner and outer joins, within one query can address varying data relationships effectively.
- The evidence leans toward leveraging temporary tables, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and subqueries to manage and simplify complex queries, especially in MySQL 8.0 and later.

---

### Understanding Complex Joins
Complex joins involve combining data from three or more tables, often requiring different join types to handle relationships. For example, you might use an inner join for guaranteed matches and a left join for optional matches, as seen in the police database example with `crime`, `location`, and `suspect` tables.

### Managing Result Sets
You can control query results using `LIMIT` to restrict rows or `UNION` to combine results from multiple queries, ensuring efficient data retrieval and presentation.

### Advanced Techniques
Temporary tables, CTEs (introduced in MySQL 8.0), derived tables, and subqueries offer ways to break down complex queries into manageable parts, improving readability and performance. For instance, CTEs allow naming temporary result sets for use within a single query, simplifying multi-table joins.

## üìã Survey Note: Detailed Exploration of Complex SQL Joins

This survey note provides a comprehensive analysis of performing complex joins with multiple tables in SQL, covering all aspects from the user's provided content and additional insights. It includes detailed explanations, examples, and best practices, ensuring a thorough understanding for both beginners and advanced users. üöÄ

### üåü Introduction to Complex Joins

In SQL, joining multiple tables is a fundamental operation for retrieving and combining data from relational databases. While Chapter 5 introduced joining two tables, this chapter delves into complex joins involving three or more tables, introducing greater complexity due to potential different join types and relationships. The user's content highlights several databases, such as the police database, wine database, and nutrition database, to illustrate these concepts. Let's explore each aspect in detail. üìö

#### üìå Writing One Query with Two Join Types

When joining three or more tables, you might need to use different join types within the same query. For example, consider the police database with `location`, `crime`, and `suspect` tables:

- **Location Table**:
  ```
  location_id  location_name
  ---------    ----------------
  1            Corner of Main and Elm
  2            Family Donut Shop
  3            House of Vegan Restaurant
  ```

- **Crime Table**:
  ```
  crime_id  location_id  suspect_id  crime_name
  --------  -----------  ----------  --------------------------------
  1         1            1           Jaywalking
  2         2            2           Larceny: Donut
  3         3            NULL        Receiving Salad Under False Pretenses
  ```

- **Suspect Table**:
  ```
  suspect_id  suspect_name
  ----------  ---------------
  1           Eileen Sideways
  2           Hugo Hefty
  ```

You want to list crimes, their locations, and suspects. Since every crime has a location (inner join), but not all crimes have a suspect (outer join), the query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT c.crime_name, l.location_name, s.suspect_name
FROM crime c
JOIN location l ON c.location_id = l.location_id
LEFT JOIN suspect s ON c.suspect_id = s.suspect_id;
```

**Explanation** üéØ:
- The `JOIN` (inner join) between `crime` and `location` ensures only crimes with matching locations are included.
- The `LEFT JOIN` with `suspect` includes all crimes, even if no suspect is identified (resulting in `NULL` for `suspect_name`).
- MySQL processes joins sequentially: first, it joins `crime` and `location`, then performs a left join with `suspect`.

**Result**:
```
crime_name                          location_name        suspect_name
----------------------------------- -------------------- ----------------
Jaywalking                          Corner of Main and Elm Eileen Sideways
Larceny: Donut                      Family Donut Shop    Hugo Hefty
Receiving Salad Under False Pretenses Green Vegan Restaurant NULL
```

**Tip** üí°: Use `LEFT JOIN` when you want all rows from the left table, regardless of matches in the right table. This is useful for including records like unsolved crimes.

You can leverage `NULL` values from outer joins for filtering. For example, to list crimes with unknown suspects:

```sql
SELECT c.crime_name, l.location_name, s.suspect_name
FROM crime c
JOIN location l ON c.location_id = l.location_id
LEFT JOIN suspect s ON c.suspect_id = s.suspect_id
WHERE s.suspect_name IS NULL;
```

**Result**:
```
crime_name                          location_name        suspect_name
----------------------------------- -------------------- ----------------
Receiving Salad Under False Pretenses Green Vegan Restaurant NULL
```

**Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è: Mixing join types can be confusing. Always document the query logic for maintainability.

#### üìå Joining Many Tables

MySQL allows joining up to 61 tables in a single query, though practical limits are much lower due to performance concerns. The wine database example with six tables (`country`, `region`, `viticultural_area`, `winery`, `portfolio`, `wine_type`) illustrates this:

- **Country Table**:
  ```
  country_id  country_name
  ---------   ------------
  1           France
  2           Spain
  3           USA
  ```

- **Region Table**:
  ```
  region_id  region_name      country_id
  --------- ---------------  ----------
  1          Napa Valley     3
  2          Walla Walla Valley 3
  3          Texas Hill      3
  ```

- **Viticultural Area Table**:
  ```
  viticultural_area_id  viticultural_area_name  region_id
  -------------------  ----------------------  ---------
  1                    Atlas Peak             1
  2                    Calistoga              1
  3                    Wild Horse Valley      1
  ```

- **Wine Type Table**:
  ```
  wine_type_id  wine_type_name
  ------------  ------------------
  1             Chardonnay
  2             Cabernet Sauvignon
  3             Merlot
  ```

- **Winery Table**:
  ```
  winery_id  winery_name            viticultural_area_id  offering_tours_flag
  ---------  ---------------------  -------------------  -------------------
  1          Silva Vineyards        1                    0
  2          Chateau Traileur Parc  2                    1
  3          Winosaur Estate        3                    1
  ```

- **Portfolio Table**:
  ```
  winery_id  wine_type_id  in_season_flag
  ---------  ------------  --------------
  1          1             1
  1          2             1
  1          3             0
  2          1             1
  2          2             1
  2          3             1
  3          1             1
  3          2             1
  3          3             1
  ```

To find US wineries offering in-season Merlot with tours:

```sql
SELECT c.country_name, r.region_name, v.viticultural_area_name, w.winery_name
FROM country c
JOIN region r ON c.country_id = r.country_id AND c.country_name = 'USA'
JOIN viticultural_area v ON r.region_id = v.region_id
JOIN winery w ON v.viticultural_area_id = w.viticultural_area_id AND w.offering_tours_flag = 1
JOIN portfolio p ON w.winery_id = p.winery_id AND p.in_season_flag = 1
JOIN wine_type t ON p.wine_type_id = t.wine_type_id AND t.wine_type_name = 'Merlot';
```

**Result**:
```
country_name  region_name      viticultural_area_name  winery_name
------------  ---------------  ----------------------  ---------------------
USA           Napa Valley      Calistoga              Chateau Traileur Parc
USA           Napa Valley      Wild Horse Valley      Winosaur Estate
```

**Tip** üí°: Use multiple conditions in `ON` clauses with `AND` for precise joins, especially when filtering (e.g., `c.country_name = 'USA'`).

**Best Practice**: Limit joins to 10 tables or fewer for performance; consider redesigning the database if more are needed.

#### üìå Associative Tables

Associative tables, like `portfolio`, link two tables (e.g., `winery` and `wine_type`) for many-to-many relationships. They contain foreign keys referencing primary keys of related tables.

**Example Query**:
```sql
SELECT w.winery_name, t.wine_type_name
FROM winery w
JOIN portfolio p ON w.winery_id = p.winery_id
JOIN wine_type t ON p.wine_type_id = t.wine_type_id;
```

**Result**:
```
winery_name            wine_type_name
---------------------  ------------------
Silva Vineyards        Chardonnay
Silva Vineyards        Cabernet Sauvignon
Silva Vineyards        Merlot
Chateau Traileur Parc  Chardonnay
...
```

**Explanation** üéØ: The `portfolio` table associates wineries with wine types, enabling queries to list all wines offered by each winery.

#### üìå Managing the Data in Your Result Set

SQL provides tools to control result sets:

- **Using `LIMIT`**:
  Example: Top 3 wines from a contest.
  ```sql
  SELECT wine_name, place
  FROM best_wine_contest
  ORDER BY place
  LIMIT 3;
  ```
  Result:
  ```
  wine_name    place
  ----------   -----
  Riesling     1
  Pinot Grigio 2
  Zinfandel    3
  ```

- **Using `UNION`**:
  Combine wine types from `wine_type` and `best_wine_contest`.
  ```sql
  SELECT wine_type_name FROM wine_type
  UNION
  SELECT wine_name FROM best_wine_contest;
  ```
  Result:
  ```
  wine_type_name
  --------------
  Chardonnay
  Cabernet Sauvignon
  Merlot
  Riesling
  Pinot Grigio
  Zinfandel
  Malbec
  Verdejo
  ```

  **Note**: `UNION` removes duplicates; use `UNION ALL` for duplicates.

#### üìå Temporary Tables

Temporary tables store intermediate results for session use, automatically dropped at session end.

**Example**: Create a temporary table for wineries offering tours with in-season Merlot.
```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE winery_portfolio
SELECT w.winery_name, w.viticultural_area_id
FROM winery w
JOIN portfolio p ON w.winery_id = p.winery_id AND w.offering_tours_flag = 1 AND p.in_season_flag = 1
JOIN wine_type t ON p.wine_type_id = t.wine_type_id AND t.wine_type_name = 'Merlot';
```

Query it:
```sql
SELECT * FROM winery_portfolio;
```
Result:
```
winery_name            viticultural_area_id
---------------------  --------------------
Chateau Traileur Parc  2
Winosaur Estate        3
```

**Tip** üí°: Use temporary tables to simplify large queries by breaking them into parts.

#### üìå Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Introduced in MySQL 8.0, CTEs are named temporary result sets for a single query.

**Example**: Simplify the wine query using a CTE.
```sql
WITH winery_portfolio_cte AS (
  SELECT w.winery_name, w.viticultural_area_id
  FROM winery w
  JOIN portfolio p ON w.winery_id = p.winery_id AND w.offering_tours_flag = 1 AND p.in_season_flag = 1
  JOIN wine_type t ON p.wine_type_id = t.wine_type_id AND t.wine_type_name = 'Merlot'
)
SELECT c.country_name, r.region_name, v.viticultural_area_name, wp.winery_name
FROM country c
JOIN region r ON c.country_id = r.country_id AND c.country_name = 'USA'
JOIN viticultural_area v ON r.region_id = v.region_id
JOIN winery_portfolio_cte wp ON v.viticultural_area_id = wp.viticultural_area_id;
```

**Explanation** üéØ: The CTE isolates the complex join logic, making the main query cleaner.

**Note**: CTEs are query-scoped, unlike temporary tables, which persist for the session.

#### üìå Derived Tables

Derived tables are subqueries in the FROM clause, available for the query's duration.

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT wot.winery_name, t.wine_type_name
FROM portfolio p
JOIN wine_type t ON p.wine_type_id = t.wine_type_id
JOIN (
  SELECT *
  FROM winery
  WHERE offering_tours_flag = 1
) wot ON p.winery_id = wot.winery_id;
```

**Tip** üí°: Choose between CTEs and derived tables based on readability; CTEs are often preferred for complex queries.

#### üìå Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries

Subqueries nest within another query, returning data for the main query.

**Example**: Find regions in the USA.
```sql
SELECT region_name
FROM region
WHERE country_id = (
  SELECT country_id
  FROM country
  WHERE country_name = 'USA'
);
```
Result:
```
region_name
------------------
Napa Valley
Walla Walla Valley
Texas Hill
```

Correlated subqueries reference outer query columns.

**Example**: Highest-paid employees per department.
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employee e
WHERE salary = (
  SELECT b.salary
  FROM best_paid b
  WHERE b.department = e.department
);
```
Result:
```
employee_name    salary
--------------  ------
Wanda Wealthy    200000
Betty Builder    80000
Sean Soldering   80000
```

**Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è: Ensure subqueries return one row with `=`; use `IN` for multiple rows to avoid errors.

### üéØ Try It Yourself Solutions

The user provided exercises for the nutrition and canada databases. Here are solutions:

- **6-1**: Display all snacks from `good_snack` and `bad_snack`.
  ```sql
